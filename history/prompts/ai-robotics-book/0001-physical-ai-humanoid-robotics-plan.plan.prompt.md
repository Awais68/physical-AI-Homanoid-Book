## Prompt

Create a complete project plan for a learning resource book on "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics".

Include:
1. Chapter architecture with subsections.
2. Learning goals for each chapter.
3. Research approach (sources, workflow).
4. Quality validation strategy.
5. Decisions to document (depth, scope, ethics, visuals, edge-case coverage).
6. Testing strategy for content, academic rigor, structure, and impact.
7. Technical details including workflow phases and edge-case constraints.


Technical details:
- Use research-concurrent approach (research while writing, not all upfront)
- Follow APA citation style from Constitution
- Organize by phases: Research → Foundation → Analysis → Synthesis
