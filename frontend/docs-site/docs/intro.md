# Welcome

Welcome to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics in Education. This is your comprehensive guide to integrating advanced robotics into learning.

## Learning Objectives

After reading this book, you will be able to:

- Understand the scope and boundaries of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics in educational contexts
- Identify and address key ethical dilemmas in educational robotics
- Apply technical concepts to educational settings
- Implement pedagogically sound approaches to using humanoid robots
- Adapt implementations for different educational levels
- Follow best practices for implementation in educational settings
- Ensure compliance with data privacy and security requirements

## Getting Started

Get started by exploring our tutorials and documentation. We recommend beginning with the [Scope and Boundaries](./01-scope-boundaries.md) to understand the educational contexts covered in this book, then exploring [Ethical Dilemmas & Controversies](./02-ethical-dilemmas.md) to consider important ethical implications.

## What you'll learn

- Fundamentals of Physical AI
- Humanoid Robotics concepts
- Educational frameworks
- Implementation strategies
