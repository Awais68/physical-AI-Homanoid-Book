# Robotics Diagrams and Illustrations

This directory contains diagrams and illustrations for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics in Education book.

## Planned Diagrams

### 1. Robot Architecture Diagram
- Hardware components: actuators, sensors, processing units, power systems
- Software stack: low-level control, perception systems, cognition engine, interaction layer

### 2. Educational Applications Flowchart
- Shows how robots can be used across different subjects (STEM, Language Arts, Social Sciences)
- Illustrates pedagogical approaches and learning theories

### 3. Implementation Phases Timeline
- Visual representation of pilot, expansion, and full integration phases
- Key milestones and activities for each phase

### 4. Safety and Risk Management Framework
- Visual guide to safety protocols and risk mitigation strategies
- Emergency procedures and supervision requirements

### 5. Age-Appropriate Complexity Ladder
- Shows how robot interactions and tasks increase in complexity by age group
- K-5, 6-8, 9-12, and Higher Education levels

## Technical Specifications
