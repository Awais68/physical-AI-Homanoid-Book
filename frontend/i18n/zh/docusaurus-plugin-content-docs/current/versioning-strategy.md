# Content Versioning Strategy for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics in Education

## Overview
This document outlines the strategy for managing content updates and versioning to accommodate rapidly evolving technology in the field of educational robotics.

## Versioning Philosophy

### Why Versioning is Critical
- **Rapid Technological Change**: Robotics and AI technologies evolve quickly
- **Educational Standards**: Curriculum standards and pedagogical approaches change over time
- **Safety Updates**: New safety findings may require content modifications
- **Regulatory Changes**: Privacy laws and educational regulations evolve

## Versioning System

### Semantic Versioning Approach
We use semantic versioning (SemVer) to manage content updates:

- **Major Version (X.0.0)**: Significant changes affecting core concepts, major technological shifts, or fundamental pedagogical approach changes
- **Minor Version (X.Y.0)**: New content additions, updated examples, or moderate technological updates
- **Patch Version (X.Y.Z)**: Corrections, clarifications, bug fixes, or minor updates

### Version Labels
- **Alpha (a)**: Experimental content, early drafts, untested approaches
- **Beta (b)**: Content ready for pilot testing, requires validation
- **Release Candidate (rc)**: Content ready for release pending final review
- **Release**: Production-ready content

## Content Update Process

### Monitoring Technology Changes
- **Industry Tracking**: Regular monitoring of robotics industry developments
- **Research Integration**: Incorporation of new educational research findings
- **Community Feedback**: Input from educators using the content
- **Technology Partners**: Updates from robot manufacturers and platform providers

### Update Frequency
- **Major Updates**: Annually, aligned with academic year planning
- **Minor Updates**: Quarterly, based on technological developments
- **Patch Updates**: As needed, particularly for safety or regulatory changes

## Change Management

### Change Classification
1. **Critical Changes**: Safety issues, regulatory compliance, or fundamental errors
2. **Important Changes**: New research, major technological advances, or curriculum shifts
3. **Beneficial Changes**: Improved examples, better explanations, or minor enhancements
4. **Optional Changes**: Alternative approaches or supplementary content

### Notification System
- **Email Alerts**: For educators and institutions using the content
- **In-Platform Notifications**: Direct notifications within the learning platform
- **Version History**: Clear documentation of all changes
- **Migration Guides**: Support for transitioning between versions

## Content Lifecycle

### Content Age Management
- **Active Content**: Less than 2 years old, actively maintained
- **Legacy Content**: 2-4 years old, stable but not actively updated
- **Archived Content**: Over 4 years old, preserved for reference but not recommended

### Sunset Policy
- Content older than 4 years will be clearly marked as archived
- Deprecated content will be maintained for 6 months after replacement
- Users will be notified 3 months before content is removed from active rotation

## Technology-Specific Considerations

### Hardware Updates
- Robot model specifications and capabilities
- Compatibility with new hardware releases
- Discontinued product support strategies

### Software Updates
- API changes and version compatibility
- Platform migration requirements
- Code example updates

### Pedagogical Updates
- New teaching methodologies
- Updated learning theories
- Evolved educational standards

## Implementation Guidelines

### For Educators
- **Version Awareness**: Understand which version of content you're using
- **Update Planning**: Plan for content updates in curriculum design
- **Feedback Submission**: Report issues or suggest improvements
- **Transition Support**: Utilize migration resources for version changes

### For Content Developers
- **Change Documentation**: Clearly document all content changes
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain compatibility when possible
- **Testing Requirements**: Validate changes in educational settings
- **Review Process**: Follow established review procedures

## Quality Assurance

### Review Process
1. **Technical Review**: Verify technical accuracy and safety
2. **Pedagogical Review**: Ensure educational effectiveness
3. **Accessibility Review**: Confirm accessibility compliance
4. **Legal Review**: Validate regulatory compliance

### Testing Requirements
- Pilot testing with educators and students
- Technical compatibility verification
- Safety protocol validation
- Accessibility standard compliance

## Version Control Best Practices

### Git Workflow
- **Branch Strategy**: Feature branches for content updates
- **Pull Requests**: Required for all content changes
- **Code Review**: Peer review for all significant changes
- **Automated Testing**: CI/CD pipeline for quality checks

### Documentation Standards
- Clear commit messages explaining changes
- Comprehensive pull request descriptions
- Updated documentation with all changes
- Version history tracking

## Communication Strategy

### Stakeholder Communication
- **Educators**: Regular updates on content changes
- **Institutions**: Advance notice of major version changes
- **Students**: Clear indication of content versions used
- **Researchers**: Information about content evolution

### Change Announcements
- **Major Releases**: Comprehensive release notes and training
- **Minor Updates**: Summary of changes and impact
- **Patches**: Critical issue notifications
- **Archival**: Clear communication about content retirement

## Success Metrics

### Version Adoption
- Percentage of users on current version
- Time to adoption for new versions
- Feedback quality and quantity

### Content Quality
- Error and issue reports
- User satisfaction ratings
- Educational effectiveness measures
- Technical accuracy verification
