## Introduction to Physical AI

Physical AI represents the intersection of artificial intelligence and physical embodiment. Unlike traditional AI that operates in digital spaces, Physical AI systems exist in the real world and must navigate complex physical and social environments.

### Key Characteristics
- **Embodiment**: The AI system has a physical form that interacts with the real world
- **Real-time Processing**: Must respond to environmental changes in real-time
- **Multi-modal Interaction**: Uses multiple sensory inputs and outputs
- **Adaptive Learning**: Adjusts behavior based on physical interactions

## Humanoid Robot Architecture

### Hardware Components
- **Actuators**: Motors and servos that enable movement
- **Sensors**: Cameras, microphones, touch sensors, and environmental detectors
- **Processing Units**: Onboard computers for real-time decision making
- **Power Systems**: Batteries and power management for sustained operation

### Software Stack
- **Low-level Control**: Motor control and sensor feedback
- **Perception Systems**: Object recognition, speech recognition, emotion detection
- **Cognition Engine**: Decision making and behavior selection
- **Interaction Layer**: Communication protocols and user interface systems

## AI and Machine Learning in Humanoid Robots

### Perception and Recognition
- **Computer Vision**: Object, face, and gesture recognition
- **Natural Language Processing**: Understanding and generating human language
