---

### Dependencies
- Phase 1 tasks must be completed before subsequent phases.
- Foundational tasks (Phase 2) are prerequisites for all chapter-specific tasks.
- Chapter-specific tasks (Phase 4) can be performed in parallel for different chapters, but within each chapter, Research, Writing, Structure, and Review tasks are sequential.
- Back Matter (Phase 5) and Cross-Cutting Concerns (Phase 6) are dependent on the completion of core chapter content.

### Parallel Execution Examples
- Multiple research tasks for different chapters can run in parallel (e.g., T022 [P] and T028 [P]).
- Initial drafting of Front Matter sections can run in parallel (e.g., T016 [P], T017 [P]).
- Within Phase 4, tasks for different chapters (e.g., all tasks for Chapter 1 and all tasks for Chapter 2) can theoretically be initiated in parallel, though dependencies within each chapter should be respected.
