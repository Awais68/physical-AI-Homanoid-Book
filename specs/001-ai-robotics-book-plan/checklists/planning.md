## Content Quality

- [x] Plan addresses all user-requested sections (Chapter architecture, Learning goals, Research approach, Quality validation, Decisions to document, Testing strategy, Technical details).
- [x] Technical details align with user requests (research-concurrent, APA, Research -> Foundation -> Analysis -> Synthesis phases).
- [x] Chapter architecture is logical and includes subsections.
- [x] Learning goals are defined for each chapter (implied by content structure).

## Plan Completeness

- [x] Research approach is clearly defined with sources and workflow.
- [x] Quality validation strategy is comprehensive, covering content, academic rigor, structure, and impact.
- [x] Decisions to document are identified.
- [x] Testing strategy for content, academic rigor, structure, and impact is defined.
- [x] Technical details, including workflow phases and edge-case constraints, are present.

## Plan Readiness

- [x] Plan is detailed enough for task generation.
- [x] No ambiguities or placeholders remain.

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require plan updates before `/sp.tasks`.
