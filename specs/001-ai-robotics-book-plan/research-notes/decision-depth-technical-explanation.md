# Decision Record: Depth of Technical Explanation

## Decision
The learning resource book on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics in Education will aim for a balance between technical depth and accessibility, targeting an intermediate academic audience (undergraduate engineering & CS students, robotics/AI/Mechatronics learners, self-learners, and early-career developers).

## Rationale
This approach ensures the book provides sufficient rigor for students and professionals in technical fields, offering a solid foundational understanding of complex concepts. Simultaneously, it maintains accessibility for self-learners and those transitioning into the field, preventing them from being overwhelmed by excessive, highly specialized mathematical or engineering details.

## Trade-offs
-   **Accessibility vs. Comprehensiveness**: While striving for comprehensiveness, highly advanced or niche research topics that might overwhelm the target audience will be referenced for further reading rather than covered in explicit detail within the main text. This avoids diluting the core message and maintains a focused learning path.
-   **Engagement vs. Rigor**: Overly simplified explanations might lead to a lack of academic rigor, while excessive technical jargon without proper scaffolding could reduce engagement. The chosen balance aims to present complex ideas with clarity and real-world relevance, supported by necessary mathematical or technical foundations, as outlined in the constitution (e.g., equations, derivations, algorithms where necessary).

## Impact
-   **Positive**: Broadens the book's appeal to a wider range of technical learners, making it a valuable resource for both formal education and self-study. Facilitates a deeper understanding of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics without requiring prior expert-level knowledge.
-   **Negative**: May require careful judgment in content generation to ensure consistent depth across chapters, avoiding areas that are either too simplistic or too complex for the defined audience.
