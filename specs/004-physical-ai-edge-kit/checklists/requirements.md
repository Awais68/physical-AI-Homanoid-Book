# Specification Quality Checklist: Physical AI Edge Kit for Educational Robotics

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-10
**Feature**: [Link to spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - All technical implementation details have been removed or generalized
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs - Specification focuses on user stories and outcomes
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders - Language is accessible to business stakeholders
- [X] All mandatory sections completed - All required sections are present

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain - All clarifications have been addressed
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous - All requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] Success criteria are measurable - All success criteria include specific metrics
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details) - Success criteria focus on outcomes
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined - Each user story has clear acceptance scenarios
- [X] Edge cases are identified - Edge cases section is present and populated
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded - User stories and requirements define clear scope
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified - Dependencies and assumptions sections are complete

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria - Each requirement is testable
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows - All major user journeys are documented
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria - Success metrics are defined
- [X] No implementation details leak into specification - Specification focuses on WHAT not HOW

## Notes

- All validation items have been completed successfully
